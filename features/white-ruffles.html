			<h1>White Ruffles</h1>
			<img src="img/the-dance.jpg">
			<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
			<p>I think of you and I think TALL.<br>
				As we danced, the buttons on your shirt front<br>
				Pressed circles on my face,<br>
				Your angular cheekbones a sharp contrast<br>
				To my dimpled softness.</p>
			<p>The hormone-sweet smell of youth<br>
				Seeped through the starched white cotton of your shirt<br>
				As we waltzed carefree and young of heart<br>
				To the wedding altar.<br>
				We laughed often and joked of<br>
				Growing old together.</p>
			<p>I was radiant and dizzy with love<br>
				You called me your princess in lace veil<br>
				And white ruffles.</p>
			<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
			<p>Through open windows gossamer curtains<br>
				Blew freely in the wind.<br>
				The white ruffles waved in celebration<br>
				As we joined in primal mating on your grandmother&#39;s<br>
				Four poster bed.<br>
				Youthful lust waned as the babies came,<br>
				One-two-three robust and red cheeked.</p>
			<p>Hell-bent on perfection<br>
				I followed modern marriage manuals to the letter.<br>
				White ruffles were replaced by blue jeans and aprons.<br>
				You never did learn to like tuna in a casserole.</p>
			<p>And I never ever said no<br>
				To your fumbling hands sneaking the warmth of my body&#39;s secrets<br>
				Under hidden cover of the night.<br>
				Other nights I tuned in for the sound of your truck<br>
				Purring home at last in the driveway.</p>
			<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
			<p>One 2am you covered me with wafting dollar bills<br>
				Won in a craps game,<br>
				And I wondered what that had to do with the truck business,<br>
				But I wasn&#39;t going to harp like my mother.<br>
				They said she killed my father with a heart attack.<br>
				So I said nothing.<br>
				Your golden wedding band flew out of the window with a beer can<br>
				One blistery winter night<br>
				You said.<br>
				Your fingers were slim and shrunk from the cold<br>
				You said.</p>
			<p><strong>IV.</strong></p>
			<p>Was it 1987 we celebrated the new year<br>
				In the Laundromat?<br>
				We toasted new beginnings<br>
				Over the water sloshing and the<br>
				Whump-whump of tennis shoes in the dryer.<br>
				What followed was the first job lost.<br>
				(Due to missing company funds I was told.)<br>
				T&#39;was not the last.<br>
				The spiral hastened<br>
				Down,<br>
				Always accompanied by a Schlitz Tallboy<br>
				Gripped tightly in your bony knuckles<br>
				Until the cool metal container became indistinguishable<br>
				From your hand.</p>
			<p><strong>V.</strong></p>
			<p>Frantic for a solution,<br>
				One night I sent the children away and<br>
				Served you steak and wine in unfamiliar candlelight that<br>
				Spiked eerie shadows over children&#39;s toys and the worn out high chair.<br>
				I used all the woman-tricks I knew<br>
				To ease the frown in your face.<br>
				I listened.<br>
				I laughed.<br>
				I cajoled.<br>
				I flirted.<br>
				I fucked,<br>
				But I could not compete with the golden liquid brew.<br>
				It gave you seductive solace I could not.<br>
				I was your judge and jury and<br>
				It had become your understanding,<br>
				Forever faithless friend.<br>
				My Pollyanna smile became a frozen grimace mask.<br>
				And I looked for shabby comfort wherever I could.<br>
				You never even noticed.</p>
			<p>Finally I fled,</p>
			<p>We become one more divorce statistic.<br>
				Dated May 18th.</p>
			<p><strong>VI.</strong></p>
			<p>The last time I saw you,<br>
				You sat heavily in our easy chair,<br>
				Gray trousers dark-stained and urine-damp.<br>
				Your head hung low.<br>
				Your watery blue eyes pleaded for help as the coffee cup trembled<br>
				In your long slender fingers.<br>
				Our children gaped in adolescent horror at the shrunken visage<br>
				Of their hero-daddy.<br>
				I didn&#39;t know what to do!<br>
				I couldn&#39;t return you to what you had become.<br>
				Spending nights in a cold borrowed car<br>
				Writing hot checks<br>
				Sleeping in a cemetery surrounded by metal vaults and stone pillars.<br>
				You surrendered meekly enough as<br>
				Our son dressed you up.<br>
				I tucked a clean white hanky in your pocket<br>
				And sent you home to the first woman who ever loved you.</p>
			<p>Safely tucked away in my file cabinet along with car titles,<br>
				Life insurance policies, and 20-year roof warranties is<br>
				The Coroner&#39;s Report.<br>
				&quot;Self-Inflicted gunshot wound&quot;<br>
				States the ragged piece of paper.<br>
				The death notice of white ruffles&#39; dreams is<br>
				Dated May 18th.</p>
			<p><strong>VII.</strong></p>
			<p>Today I live in a reasonable world with reality as my companion.<br>
				My dreamy dimples have deepened with age<br>
				Thank God I no longer need fairy tale heroes.</p>
			<p>A pale flag flaps wildly in the winter wind.<br>
				White lilacs in the first blush of spring,</p>
			<p>White ruffle dreams into my grown-up mind.<br>
				Then<br>
				The warm body next to me moves closer<br>
				In the rustle of the night and<br>
				I imperfectly love an imperfect man.</p>
			<p>Gratitude bathes me in a rosy glow<br>
				As my heart smiles in the night.<br>
				I think of me and I know:<br>
				Blessed.<br>
				I think of you and I pray:<br>
				Peace.</p>
