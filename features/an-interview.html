            <h1>Excerpt from an Interview</h1>
<h3>You just had to use your imagination.</h3>

<p>Wallace Heller crafts fiction.</p>
<p>That resonates where it must.</p>
<p>And liberates where it can.</p>
<p>All the rest is up to you.</p>
<p>Born and raised in the Bronx&mdash;a transplant to Miami&mdash;Wallace has worked in a bindery, as a bar tender, in a flea market, and on a fishing boat in the Keys.</p>
<p>Storytelling goes way back.</p>
<blockquote><p>PS 185 sat in the middle of city housing, separated by a patch of asphalt surrounded by a chain link fence. Recess was a time of discovery&mdash;you got to see who visited your building during the day&mdash;who came and went when others weren&#39;t around. Sometimes mom would peek out the window and shout. The far side of the fence had a gate so tall it touched the sky. Chained shut, the gate budged a little if you pushed it&mdash;kids were always trying to squeeze through. Hector Rodriguez got stuck once&mdash;the fire department came to get him out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&quot;In six years of primary school I never saw that gate open&mdash;not even once.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&quot;You just had to use your imagination.&quot;</p>
