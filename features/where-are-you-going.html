			<p>What if somebody told you that the road you're on led nowhere&mdash;before you got to the point of no turning back?</p>
			<p>What if somebody showed you that you're making a big mistake&mdash;while you still had time to do something about it?</p>
			<p>What if somebody gave you a glimpse, a hint, a moment of clarity&mdash;before you got stuck in a life that you hate?</p>
			<p>Would you do things differently?</p>
			<p>Would you slow down?</p>
			<p>Would you listen?</p>
			<p>Would you think twice?</p>
			<p>Here's a clue.</p>
			<p>Sometimes&mdash;maybe all the time, I don't know&mdash;<br>
			the destination isn't what you dream,<br>
			the consequences aren't what you imagine,<br>
			the payoff isn't anything like the promise,<br>
			the true cost is a lot more than the price on the sticker,<br>
			a hard road hides behind an easy first step,<br>
			rust sticks around a lot longer than glitter,<br>
			getting what you want doesn't mean you've won,<br>
			every betrayal starts with a kiss,<br>
			and new things grow old faster than you ever thought possible.</p>

				<p>Maybe I'm full of s***. You decide.</p>

			<p>I'm twenty eight now, but I was seventeen once too. I thought I knew better then. Now I do.</p>
			<p>Is this what is meant by coming full circle? Or trying to pay it forward? Or am I just kidding myself, because that's less painful that admitting that there is no hope at all, ever, anywhere.</p>
			<p>I'm trying to tell you something, and I know you don't want to hear it. But I'm going to try anyway. I'm going to tell you something that will change your life if you'll give it half a chance.</p>
			<p>I know you don't have to listen to me. I stopped listening as soon as I saw that I didn't have to anymore, not that anybody was saying anything meaningful anyway.</p>
			<p>Maybe that's what makes this different. Maybe I have something to say that will help you avoid making the same mistakes I made, learning lessons the hard way, wishing every moment of every day that things were different.</p>
			<p>Maybe I'm full of s***. You decide.</p>
			<p>These are your choices, and they will have consequences. No getting out of that.</p>
			<p>There's one last question that has to be asked, sooner or later. It may not make sense at the moment, but someday it will.</p>
			<p>What would you give to get your innocence back?</p>
