			<h3>What she really wanted.</h3>

			<p>A little girl sits on a porch holding something precious in her hands.</p>
			<p>The year he passed, Paw-paw (the good one, not the other) gave her a cotton comb for her birthday. Short stiff bristles and a wooden handle worn smooth from years of use. Paw-Paw&#39;s father gave it to him when Paw-Paw was a boy.</p>
			<p>One day, Mom takes it, takes it and sells it to a neighbor, an acquaintance, somebody she just met.</p>
			<p>Said they were broke. Needed money. Hurried off when she got it.
				A while later the screen door slams. The girl hears Mom opening drawers and cupboards in the kitchen.</p>
			<p>&quot;No god-damned matches.&quot; Mom&#39;s voice trails off.</p>
			<p>For the price of an old cotton comb, a birthday gift from a man who left and won&#39;t be back, Mom got what she wanted most.</p>
			<p>She had been to the store. Her purchases lay on the counter.</p>
			<p>Beer and cigarettes.</p>
