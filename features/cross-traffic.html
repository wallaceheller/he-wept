			<h3>Nobody lingers here.</h3>

			<p>A hatchback slams.</p>
			<p>The door of a van rolls shut.</p>
			<p>Brakes squeal. Horns blare. Two cars nearly collide backing up at once. An obscene gesture. “¡Hijo de puta!” An elderly man drives off afraid.</p>
			<p>Exhaust mingles with the stench of rubbish from a barrel that hasn't been emptied and the odor of grease from the fryer at Burger Boy.</p>
			<p>Welcome to Lot C.</p>
			<p>Empty and bleak at 2 AM.</p>
			<p>Mayhem on Saturday afternoon.</p>
			<p>“Littering, loitering, skateboarding, ball playing, soliciting, overnight parking PROHIBITED,” says the sign. “Video surveillance in use.” “Management assumes no responsibility.”</p>
			<p>A discarded Orange Julius cup bears the imprint of the tire that flattened it.</p>
			<p>A half finished box of Karmelkorn sits on the curb.</p>
			<p>Nobody lingers here&mdash;nobody stands around except to smoke a cigarette on her ten minute break. This is the place to park and lock. The place where couples quarrel, kids squirm and wail, and single moms make sure the car seat is buckled just right.</p>
			<p>Want some advice? Remember your row. Don't leave packages in plain sight. Report suspicious activity. Cross traffic does not stop.</p>
			<p>Longing for something that turns you around completely? That captivates instead of seduces? That inspires instead of distracts?</p>
			<p>This is merchandise outside the box. No fads. No gimmicks. No cards to swipe. No points to redeem. Not even Green Stamps.</p>
			<p>Dignity and freedom don't carry stickers that say Made in China when you turn them upside down. Purpose and love can't be found at a “2 for 1 Pre-Clearance Blowout.”</p>
			<p>Longing for clarity, insight, something more than hype and hypocrisy? Something meaningful that lasts? Somebody who understands? A way out of the emptiness and loneliness? Or just a way out?</p>
			<p>Welcome to Lot C Media.</p>
