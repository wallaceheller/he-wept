			<p>They have a look all their own &mdash; those instant photos that come out of the machine at the mall.</p>
			<p>Two dollars. Four poses. Ready in minutes.</p>
			<p>You retrieve them from the chute, damp and sticky even after the blower shuts off.</p>
			<p>Forced smiles. Awkward, made-up expressions. It's hard not to blink.</p>
			<p>The features are always blurry, the colors dark and run together or washed out when the chemicals need changing.</p>
			<p>Call them a keepsake, a memento, a souvenir that goes home in a pocket to be set aside, forgotten like dreams and other things you buy.</p>
			<p>Then one day you discover them in a drawer of stuff that mattered once and marvel at who you were and who you've become and how the time has passed.</p>
			<p>There's only one thing left to do.</p>
			<p>Choose.</p>
			<p>Save them for a rainy day? Another rainy day like today.</p>
			<p>Or &mdash;</p>
			<p>Embrace the knowledge that no one really cares. There's no one coming after you to whom they matter.</p>
			<p>The landfill awaits. Everything you ever cherished or thought you cherished or might cherish.</p>
			<p>Everything in that drawer and on that shelf and in that box in the closet.</p>
			<p>Take one last look. Go on. It won't hurt any more than it has to.</p>
			<p>Then say good-bye.</p>
			<p>Put on a smile. It will brighten the day of the guy or gal who has to close the drawer &mdash; the one made of stainless steel that has you in it.</p>
