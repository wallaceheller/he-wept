<p class="caption">Wow! (Photo by author.)</p>
<p>They say it has to be in plain speak.</p>
<p>Well, here it is.</p>
<p>IT GLEAMS.</p>
<p>All that stuff we built? The tech? The apps? We gave you the world on a screen the size of your palm&mdash;the power to drown out silence, alter the scenery, make any moment your own, define reality any way you choose.</p>
<p>It came with a catch, of course&mdash;a siphon on your wages, a continuous hole in your pocket or wallet or purse. It's all by design. You didn't see it coming. You swear it isn't happening. Those who make the magic use it to harness your autonomy. Look there! Click here!</p>
<p>Is it a spell? A trance? You chose all this, right? Millions spent on marketing mean nothing. Instant gratification seduces like nothing else out there, and that's without ever going to a porn site. There are few commodities as valuable as a captive audience.</p>
<p>That thing you can't put down without feeling real pain? That's not a phone. It's a portable, pocketable, personalized advertising delivery platform. Once there were billboards along the highway and newspapers in a box at the corner, a TV on a stand across the room. Today, the content you seek seeks you, literally inches before your eyes. The distance between those who want your attention and you has never been less. Put it down. I dare you. You won't. Whether you can or can't is almost moot. You won't. And even if you did, no one else on the block will.</p>
<p>They want your attention. We want your attention. So does every startup and everyone else who's out to make a name and a buck or at least a difference.</p>
<p>Broadcast TV delivered programming to the audience and the audience to the advertisers. Print was no different. Nothing's changed with today's gig except the ubiquity, intensity, and specificity. It's always on, always in your face, and always zeroed in on you. Sure, there's an off button, but nobody ever uses it.</p>
<p>Those who make the tech use it to gather information about&mdash;and sell access to&mdash;the users. Just about everybody understands that these days. What harm does it do? What difference does it make? After all, you don't tell us EVERYTHING about yourself&mdash;you tell us just enough to know where you fit in and how you see yourself and what it takes to make you happy, how you're willing to respond, what you're ready to believe in. That's all we ever needed to sell you all you ever wanted.</p>
<p>If you weren't a consumer, what else would you be? What else is there? You construct your identity with the purchases you make, the brands you consume, the things you identify with. We harvest your dreams and desires just to sell them back to you as trinkets to wear and discard before the next batch arrives. It's not an invasion of privacy when you know perfectly well how the system works and you come back for more, again and again. At that point showing up is consent, never mind the money in your hand.</p>
<p>UNTIL IT DOESN'T.</p>
<p>He Wept rejects invasive analytics. To be fair, we do not depend on organic query driven traffic so we are not beholden to all that goes along with it. We consider this a principled approach, but&mdash;hey!&mdash;we have no skin that game, no dog in that fight&mdash;yadda yadda&mdash;so it's a position that's easy to take. Mileage, as they say, will vary. Outreach consists of QR codes plastered all over town and invites to key players (and their minions) otherwise known as influencers. Skywriting is somewhere further down the list.</p>
<p>This is our flavor, and we're sticking with it.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR.</strong>This site doesn't collect or harvest any information that personally identifies anyone. We don't violate your privacy. Heck, we don't even have a mailing list, so spam won't be a problem either.</p>
<p>One thing is sure&mdash;your time and attention come at a premium, your energy and patience too. Everybody wants a piece of the action. We can't get this wrong. We don't want to be second best. To build this brand, we've got to make it gleam in your eyes. Relevant. Inspiring. Intoxicating. Like nothing else out there. And that's on a slow day. We'll do whatever it takes to make you a fan, and you won't keep it to yourself. That's the prize.</p>
<p>All the big guys, yeah, they're trying to snatch bits and pieces of your soul. Google thrives by data mining and targeted marketing. He Wept thrives by showcasing powerful content that impacts visitors in unforgettable ways.</p>
<p>The speaking couldn't be any plainer.</p>
